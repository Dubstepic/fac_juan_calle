        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my little space on The Web. My name is Juan Calle, and I'm a proud candidate to the winter 2019 cohort of Founders and Coders. Please, feel free to explore my site and get to know me a little bit better</p>
      </div>

    <section id="aboutMe">
      <div id="aboutMe-grid">
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I often think that I'm like a human Swiss knife. I have a pretty broad range of interests that force me to keep learning new things. I crave for knowledge ALL the time.
          My studies gravitate towards creative media in all its variants: from video production to publishing, all the way to web development. I'm also a self-taught person that has learned 3D modelling, audio production, and anything that gets in
          the way of my interests. More recently, I have become a certified Dive Master and a Thai masseur, which have become my two new favourite hobbies. Some people think that I invest too much time and effort into learning new things. However, I
          believe that lifelong learning is the secret to exploit our true potential.</p>
        <h2>Why I learned to code?</h2>
        <p>Back in Spain in 2012, when I was just starting my career in Media, the economic crisis struck my country. I had to pack my stuff and move to London to start from scratch. At the time, my English skills weren't the best, so I decided to
          start working in hospitality. That industry gave me a lot of good things but didn't really satisfy my creative ambitions. Thus, I decided to learn to code. Nevertheless, the more I learned, the more I realised that I knew nothing, so I
          decided to enrol in a Bachelor's in Web Development.</p>
        <p>Once finished, and without commercial experience, finding a job proved to be a difficult task. I could have applied for internships, but I didn't have the financial means to afford to live in London without any income, so I was forced to
          go back to hospitality. Although my career in this field has thrived, I have always dreamed of becoming a full-stack software engineer, and I have tried my best to keep my skills sharp.</p>
        <h2>Where I want to go?</h2>
        <p>Firstly, I'd like to break the vicious circle that keeps me coming back to the Hospitality industry. I believe that I have a valuable skillset that can really help to satisfy the needs of many companies and help my peers achieve their
          goals. Ideally, I would like to see my career evolving towards a full-stack web developer. I'm up for any challenge that can keep me motivated, I just need that one first opportunity to step into the tech industry.</p>

    <section id="whyFC">
      <div id="whyFC-grid">
        <h1>Why F&C</h1>
        <p>In an era where coding bootcamps have become an immensely lucrative business, more focused on the profit than in the succes of their students, I fell in love with the idea of peer-led learning pioneered by Founders & Coders. There's
          something beautiful and altruistic about it that really caught my attention. Since money is removed from the equation, I believe that there must be a genuine determination to help people transform their lives and achieve their dreams.
          Sadly, nowadays, this is not common. I want to be part of the uncommon.</p>
        <p>The second reason why I chose to apply to F&C was its ethos. I believe that the tech industry is lacking some diversity in terms of gender, race, sexual orientation and gender identity, and I truly believe in the endeavours of Founders and
          Coders to change the game. Creating a space where people can develop their skills to make use of their true potential goes hand in hand with how comfortable that place makes them feel. I love that Founder and Coders is determined to create
          such a safe space so everyone can be their true selves and embrace who they are.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I love the idea of giving back by sharing knowledge. I presume the competition to get a spot in the cohort will be intense, but if given the chance I think I could be a great classmate. I enjoy sharing what I know while learning
          what I don't. I wish one day I will be able to help others to achieve their dreams in the same way that others have helped me along the way.</p>

    <section id="whatIlearned">
      <div id="whatIlearned-grid">
        <h1>What have I learned?</h1>
        <p>Although I had some previous coding experience when I started working on my prerequisites, I found my knowledge quite outdated. I didn't have a clue about ES6 or CSS Flexbox, let alone CSS grid! Thanks to my application to Founders and
          Coders, I was able to learn all the new features included in ES6. I also learned CSS Flexbox and Grid and discovered how much more straightforward the whole process has become. On the other hand, I have to say that freecodecamp is a great
          resource as a first point of contact, but I found myself craving for some more in depth knowledge. Luckily, Udemy and Lynda came to the rescue and I was able to really push my boundaries in CSS and Javascript.</p>
        <p>Codewars gave me the ultimate push to realise that I want to code for a living. Even though it was rather hard to rank up, every challenge push my boundaries and allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of algorithms and general Computer
          Science concepts. Codewars planted the seed of curiosity in my head. I realised there was so much unknown to me that I just wanted to dig deeper. Ultimately, it led me to enrol in a great online course by Harvard called CS50, where the
          foundations of Computer Science are unveiled and explained in a very entertaining way.</p>
        <p>All in all, it's been an intense but fruitful ride, and I hope to be able to put all my new skills to work in meaningful projects with the help of Founders and Coders.</p>

            <h1>Gallery</h2>
              <p>After many years, I decided to quit my thriving career in hospitality and find myself again. I managed to convice my boyfriend to come travelling with me around Asia and Australia for six months. During that time I kept working on my prerequisites, but with a much nicer view! Here are some neat pics that I took during my time there.</p>
