        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my little space on The Web. My name is Juan Calle, and I'm a proud candidate to the winter 2019 cohort of Founders and Coders. Please, feel free to explore my site and get to know me a little bit better,</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="aboutMe">
      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>I often think about myself as a swiss knife. I have a pretty broad range of interests that force me to keep learning new things. I crave for knowledge ALL the time.
      My studies gravitate towards creative media in all its variants: from video production to publishing, all the way to web development. I'm also a self-taught person that has learned 3D modelling, audio production, and anything that gets in the way of my interests. More recently, I have become a certified Dive Master and a Thai masseur, which have become my two new favourite hobbies. Some people think that I invest too much time and effort into learning new things. However, I believe that long-life learning is the secret to exploit our true potential.</p>
      <h2>Why I learned to code?</h2>
      <p>Back in Spain in 2012, when I was just starting my career in Media, the economic crisis struck my country. I had to pack my stuff and move to London to start from scratch. At the time, my English skills weren't the best, so I decided to start working in hospitality. That industry gave me a lot of good things but didn't really satisfy my creative ambitions. Thus, I decided to learn to code. Nevertheless, the more I learned, the more I realised that I knew nothing, so I decided to enrol in a Bachelor's in Web Development.</p>
      <p>Once finished, and without commercial experience, finding a job proved to be a difficult task. I could have applied for internships, but I didn't have the financial means to afford to live in London without any income, so I was forced to go back to hospitality. Although my career in this field has thrived, I have always dreamed of becoming a full-stack software engineer, and I have tried my best to keep my skills sharp.</p>
      <h2>Where I want to go?</h2>
      <p>Firstly, I'd like to break the vicious circle that keeps me coming back to the Hospitality industry. I believe that I have a valuable skillset that can really help to satisfy the needs of many companies. Ideally, I would like to see my career evolving towards a full-stack software engineer. I'm up for any challenge that can keep me motivated, I just need that one first opportunity to step into the tech industry.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="whyFC">
      <h1>WHY F&C</h1>
      <p>In an era where coding bootcamps have become a large business, mainly focused on profit instead of teaching excellence; I fell in love with the idea of peer-led learning pioneered by Founders & Coders.</p>
      <p>I love the idea of giving back and share the knowledge I've gained so far, and the one that is still to come. I wish that one day, I will be able to help others to achieve their dreams in the same way that others have helped me along the way.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="whatIlearned">
      <h1>WHAT HAVE I LEARNED?</h1>
      <p>Although I had some previous experience with coding when I started working on my prerequisites, I found my knowledge a bit outdated. Thanks to my application to Founders and Coders, I was able to learn all the new features included in ES 6. I also learned CSS Flexbox and Grid and discovered how much more straightforward the whole process has become.
      Codewars gave me the ultimate push to realise that I want to code for a living. Even though it was rather hard to rank up, every challenge push my boundaries and allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of algorithms and general Computer Science concepts.</p>
      <p>All in all, it's been an intense but fruitful ride, and I hope to be able to put all my new skills to work in meaningful projects with the help of Founders and Coders.</p>
